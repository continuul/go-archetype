Archetype is a project templating toolkit. An archetype is defined as an
original pattern or model from which all other things of the same kind are made.
Archetype is a system that provides a consistent means of generating projects of
virtually any kind.

Using archetypes provides a great way to enable developers quickly in a way
consistent with best practices employed by your project or organization.  We use
archetypes to try and get our users up and running as quickly as possible by providing a
sample project while introducing new users to current best practices. In a matter of
seconds, a new user can have a working project to use as a jumping board for their
work.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/continuul/go-archetype
